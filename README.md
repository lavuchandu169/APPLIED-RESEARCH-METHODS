# Hospital Resource Allocation System with Virtual Assistant

This project is a **Hospital Resource Allocation System** that helps optimize hospital resources such as **beds**, **staff**, and **equipment**. The system integrates **machine learning models** for predicting resource allocation and a **Virtual Assistant** powered by AI to help interact with users in real-time.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Manual Input**: Users can input hospital data (such as patient load, available staff, and equipment in use) to get predictions for optimal resource allocation.
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Get real-time recommendations for bed allocation, staff optimization, and equipment utilization.
- **AI-powered Virtual Assistant**: Powered by OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, the assistant provides real-time responses and can speak back to users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js** for the user interface.
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **Web Speech API** for voice recognition and speech synthesis.

### Backend
- **Flask** for creating the API.
- **Machine Learning models** (e.g., regression models) for predicting resource allocation.
- **OpenAI API** for integrating AI-driven conversations in the Virtual Assistant.

### Additional Tools
- **CORS** to handle cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend.

## üì• Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-resource-allocation.git
cd hospital-resource-allocation

## üñ•Ô∏è Set Up Backend

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Navigate to the backend folder and install the required dependencies:

cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2. Set Up the Models

Make sure you have your **pre-trained machine learning models** (e.g., `bed_model.pkl`, `staff_model.pkl`, and `equipment_model.pkl`) in the `/models` directory. These models are essential for predicting resource allocation.

### 3. Run the Backend Server

To start the Flask backend server, use the following command:
python app.py
The backend API will be available at http://localhost:5000.

## üåê Set Up Frontend

### 1. Install Node.js Dependencies

Navigate to the **frontend** folder and install the necessary dependencies:
cd frontend
npm install

 Run the Frontend Server
Start the React development server:

npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.


### Key Visual Enhancements:
- **Emojis**: The sections are visually enhanced with emojis like üåê for frontend setup and üíª for usage, making the sections more engaging.
- **Code Blocks**: Command snippets for `npm install` and `npm start` are properly enclosed in code blocks for better readability and easy copying.
- **Section Organization**: I‚Äôve broken up the instructions into clearly defined steps for easy navigation.

This structure will make the README clear, organized, and visually appealing to developers who view the repository on GitHub. Let me know if you'd like further modifications!
