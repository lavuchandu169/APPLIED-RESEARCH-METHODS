Hospital Resource Allocation System with Virtual Assistant
This project is a Hospital Resource Allocation System that helps optimize hospital resources such as beds, staff, and equipment. The system integrates machine learning models for predicting resource allocation and a Virtual Assistant powered by AI to help interact with users in real-time.

Features
Manual Input: Users can input hospital data (such as patient load, available staff, and equipment in use) to get predictions for optimal resource allocation.
Voice Interaction: Users can interact with the Virtual Assistant using voice commands for hands-free interaction.
Real-time Recommendations: Get real-time recommendations for bed allocation, staff optimization, and equipment utilization.
AI-powered Virtual Assistant: Powered by OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, the assistant provides real-time responses and can speak back to users.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js for the user interface.
Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend.
Web Speech API for voice recognition and speech synthesis.
Backend:
Flask for creating the API.
Machine Learning models (e.g., regression models) for predicting resource allocation.
OpenAI API (optional) for integrating AI-driven conversations in the Virtual Assistant.
Additional Tools:
CORS to handle cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend.
Installation
1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-resource-allocation.git
cd hospital-resource-allocation
2. Set up Backend
Install Python dependencies
Navigate to the backend folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the models
Make sure to have your pre-trained machine learning models (e.g., bed_model.pkl, staff_model.pkl, and equipment_model.pkl) in the /models directory.

Run the backend server
Start the Flask backend server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The backend API will be available at http://localhost:5000.

3. Set up Frontend
Install Node.js dependencies
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Run the frontend server
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Manual Input:

Enter the values for Patient Load, Staff Available, and Equipment in Use in the provided form.
Click on Get Recommendations to see the predicted values for Bed Allocation, Staff Optimization, and Equipment Utilization.
Virtual Assistant:

Use the Virtual Assistant input box to type a question (e.g., "How many beds should I allocate?").
Alternatively, click on the ðŸŽ™ Speak button to ask the assistant your question verbally.
The assistant will respond with a recommendation and speak the response back to you.
API Endpoints
POST /predict/bed_allocation: Predict the number of beds needed based on input data.
POST /predict/staff_optimization: Predict the number of staff required based on input data.
POST /predict/equipment_utilization: Predict the equipment utilization based on input data.
POST /predict/combined: Provides a combined recommendation for all resources based on input data.
